This is a skeleton project for an Android application to customize an external keyboard layout without rooting or 3rd-party keyboard installation.

It's a skeleton, so there is no apk or Play Store link. You'll have to build it and install it on a device yourself.

**Note**: if you don't want to build the app take a look at [exkeymo](https://exkeymo.herokuapp.com/). It will build the project for you but it's limited to one layout only.

# External keyboard customization
There are several ways to customize an external keyboard on Android:
1. Install 3-rd party keyboard which allows customization.
2. Add/modify [Key Layout Files](https://source.android.com/devices/input/key-layout-files) or [Key Character Map Files](https://source.android.com/devices/input/key-character-map-files) on a device with root access.
3. Install an application which provides [additional keyboard layouts](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/input/InputManager#ACTION_QUERY_KEYBOARD_LAYOUTS).
This project aims on the 3-rd option.

# The Way
1. Clone the project
2. Customize keyboard layouts.
3. Build the app and install it on your device.
4. Use your custom layout.
